        At the heart of our platform, we have a state-of-the-art Natural
        Language Processing (NLP) system that parses and understands the
        structure and semantics of the text you submit. Once your text is
        processed, our system cross-references it with a vast database of
        verified information to identify claims or statements that might need
        further verification. We also integrate with the ClaimBuster API, a
        leading tool in the fact-checking domain. This integration ensures that
        the text is checked against a wide array of sources and databases for
        utmost accuracy.{" "}

        After the analysis is complete, our platform highlights parts of the
        text that might be inaccurate or contentious, providing you with
        relevant sources or references for each identified claim.It's worth
        noting that while our system is designed to be highly accurate, no
        fact-checking tool can guarantee 100% accuracy. We always recommend
        reviewing the provided sources and using your judgment i interpreting
        theÂ results.
